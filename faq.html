					<h3 class="title_blue">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<strong>Can I request for modifications to an outfit?</strong>
<p>Sure! Whatever dress you choose to order we'll let you customize it all the way from top to bottom! Feel free to contact us any time with suggestions.</p>

<strong>Does the prices mentioned on your website include shipping?</strong>
<p>No. Since the courier fare is different for each destination, we have mentioned the price without adding it.</p>

<strong>Does the prices mentioned on your website include stitching?</strong>
<p>The prices mentioned on our website are for un-stitched suits except for the ones in readymade category.</p>

<strong>How can I make the payment?</strong>
<p>We only accept 100% payment in advance. Your order will be processed once the payment is received. Acceptable mode of payment is via any money exchange preferably western union or moneygram, etc. Further details will be provided through email once the deal is finalized.</p>

<strong>How can I place my order?</strong>
<p>1) Let us know your choice by copying and pasting the picture link location or send it by attachment in email.</p>
<p>2) Inform the number of pieces required along with their size measurements and other necessary instructions (if any).</p>

<strong>How long will it take to get my ordered goods?</strong>
<p>It depends on the type of your order. Readymade dresses and unstitched cotton lawn suits can be dispatched the very next day from the receipt of payment, but if you want stitching of cotton lawn suits to be done by us, then we need 1 week time. For party wear / bridal wear we require 3 - 4 weeks time in order to complete the handwork.</p>

<strong>If I need any alteration in readymade suit, is it possible?</strong>
<p>Size alteration is possible upto some extent in readymade suits. It will cost you additional US$5 per suit and we need 2 days time too.</p>

<strong>The price mentioned on your website are in US Dollars, how will I calculate dollars in Pak Rs. or in Pounds or Euro.</strong>
<p>We have mentioned the price in US Dollars so that it can be easy for majority of our customers as US Dollar is more convenient for them to evaluate. For your convenience, we have also installed the currency converter box on right hand side panel at bottom on our website. Just enter the price and select the currency you want to be displayed and the result is shown instantly.</p>

<strong>What are your stitching charges?</strong>
<p>We stitch exactly as per the design and pattern shown in the picture and the charges are:
Cotton lawn suits: US$20 - US$25 per suit.</p>
<p>Chiffon Dresses, Party Wears, Panel Frocks & Anarkalis: US$30 - US$35 per suit.
Bridal Wear (Shararas / Ghararas): US$40 - US$50 per dress.</p>
<p>We also have arrangement of home ladies tailors who can stitch cotton/lawn suits at US$10 - US$15 per suit, but that will not be an export standard or boutique style stitching, but still very nice, according to the picture and is best for casual wear. The choice is yours.</p>

<strong>What fabric are you using for your party wear or bridal wear?</strong>
<p>It depends on the suit but we mainly use 100% pure natural chiffon fabric or tissue and jamawaar wherever required. For trouser we use crape silk and for linings, we use pure medium silk fabric. If any special requirement, that can be arranged. Send the picture link of suit by email for which you want to know more details.</p>

<strong>What is your minimum order quantity?</strong>
<p>We recommend you to buy atleast 6 suits so that shipment charges are divided and reduced. For example 1st kg to USA is US$25 and each additional kg will cost you US$7 so if you order 1 suit, the shipment charges will be US$25 per suit but if you order 6, the shipment charges for 5kg parcel containing 6 suits will cost you US$8.83 per suit.</p>
<p>Anyways, it is your choice. You can also buy 3 suits or 1 suit too. We have no minimum order quantity limit.</p>
